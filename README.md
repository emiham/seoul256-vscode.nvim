I always though it was weird that this colorscheme was so different from the original. It turns out it was a port of a VSCode version of seoul256, which while it looked good was not very faithful to the original theme. 

I'm rewriting the [original seoul256 theme](https://github.com/junegunn/seoul256.vim) and updating it to be compatible with modern Neovim features and plugins [here](https://github.com/emiham/seoul256.nvim).

If you want to keep using this theme [this](https://github.com/bincat233/seoul256.nvim) is probably the most up-to-date fork.
